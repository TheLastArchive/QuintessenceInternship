# QuintessenceInternship

I completed a 3-month internship from May 2021 to July 2021 as a junior software developer with Quintessence (https://www.quintessencesoftware.com/) where I not only completed the projects in this repository but also gained experience with the Quintessence software and codebase. I learned about working with massive projects and codebases, finding and fixing bugs, writing clean and maintainable code, refactoring existing code along with general company and work etiquette.

My internship was incredibly enjoyable and beneficial as I was guided by exceptional mentors and surrounded by friendly and passionate co-workers while I learned invaluable skills that I will carry with me throughout my software development journey.
